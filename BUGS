Known bugs in pdftohtml 0.33:

Complex output will not work correctly when there are pages of different size
(large background image will be screwed up)
I think that in order to fix this I will have to keep some info about each page
and then run ghostscript multiple times for the page ranges with different page
sizes. On the positive size this can be used to also keep track of pages with text only.
These pages do not have to be processed by ghostscript at all.

Plain (non-complex) output might not preserve the order of text.

Page title is not set to PDF document's title. 

Still memory leaks? Rebuild with DEBUG_MEM and check for real
